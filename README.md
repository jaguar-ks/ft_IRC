# **What is IRC protocole?**

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a text-based chat system for instant messaging. IRC is designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-on-one communication via private messages as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing.[Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC)

# **Network System calls we used:**

Before start building we need of course to know the core finctionalties of some Network system calls as well.

## *What is a socket?*

- socket is a way to speak to other programs using standard Unix file descriptors.
- those files are special designed for network communication.

* For now rise the quation, How we get those kind of files?
- By a simple discription "socket()" system call came to take care of creating for us an endpoint for 
that pertuculer communication and return back a socket descriptor. by now you can communicaye through it using 
that socket by "send()" and "recv()" calls. keep in mind that u can use "read()" and "write()" but the previous
ones offer much greater control over your data transmission.

### *Types of Internet Sockets*

1. **TCP Sockets or Stream Sockers**.
	* TCP sockets provide reliable, connection-oriented communication between processes over a network.
	* They guarantee that data will be delivered in the same order it was sent and without errors.
	* TCP sockets establish a connection before transferring data, ensuring a reliable stream of data between the    	client  and server.
	* They are suitable for applications where data integrity and order are crucial, such as web browsing, email, file transfer (e.g., FTP), and remote shell access (e.g., SSH).
2. **UDP Sockets or Datagram Sockets**.
	* UDP sockets provide unreliable, connectionless communication between processes over a network.
	* They do not guarantee delivery or order of data and do not perform error checking or correction.
	* UDP sockets are more lightweight and have lower overhead compared to TCP sockets, making them suitable for real-time applications where low latency is more critical than data reliability.
	* They are commonly used in applications such as online gaming, streaming media, DNS (Domain Name System), and voice/video conferencing.
3. **Raw Sockets**.
	* Raw sockets allow direct access to network protocols at the transport layer (e.g., IP, ICMP). They provide low-level access to network packets and are often used for network monitoring, packet sniffing, and protocol development.
4. **Unix Domain Sockets.**
	*  Unix domain sockets provide communication between processes on the same host using the file system namespace instead of the network stack. They are used for inter-process communication (IPC) on Unix-like operating systems and offer higher performance and security than TCP or UDP sockets.

#### *SYSTEM CALLS*

1. **socket()** :
	* Get for u the file Descriptor, in case of a failure it retuen "-1"
2. **bind()** :
	* It has a crucial role by associatting the socket within specific network address and port number.
3. **setsocketopt()** ;
	* The setsockopt() function sets options associated with a socket. Options can exist at multiple protocol levels.
	
	
	```C
	#define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED 1
	#include <sys/socket.h>

	int setsockopt(int socket, int level, int option_name,
				const void *option_value, socklen_t option_length);

	```

	|	Parameter	 |  	 Description         					|
	| :-------------:| :----------------------- 					|
	|	socket       | The socket descriptor.    					|
	|				 |												|
	|  level         | The level for which the option is being set.	|
	|				 |	     										|
	|	option_name	 | The name of a specified socket option. 		|
	|				 | 				            					|
	|	option_value | The pointer to option data. 					|
	|				 |                      						|
	|	option_length| The length of the option data.				|

4. **Listen()** :
	* *Before you can accept incoming connections on a socket, you need to inform the operating system that the socket will be used for listening. This is where the listen() function comes in.*

5. **accept()** :
	*  Is a fundamental function in socket programming that allows a server to accept incoming connections from clients, creating a new socket for each accepted connection and enabling bidirectional communication between the server and client

```C
	#include <sys/types.h>
	#include <sys/socket.h>
	int accept(int socket, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);
```

	|	Parameter	 |  	 Description         								|
	| :-------------:| :----------------------- 								|
	|	socket       | The listen()ing socket descriptor    					|
	|				 |															|
	| 	 addr	     | The struct the holds infos about incomming connection	|
	|				 |	     													|
	|	addrlen		 | The lenght of sockaddr struct		 					|
	|				 | 				            								|

	
5. **send()/recv()**
	* *These two functions are for communicating over stream sockets or connected datagram sockets.*

6. **poll()—Synchronous I/O Multiplexing**
	* *to monitor multiple file descriptors (such as sockets, pipes, or files) for events without blocking the execution of the program.*

```C
#include <poll.h>
int poll(struct pollfd fds[], nfds_t nfds, int timeout);
```
	|	Parameter	 |  	 Description         									|
	| :-------------:| :----------------------- 									|
	|		fds	     | The array of information (which sockets to monitor for what) |
	|				 |																|
	| 	 addr	     | The count of elements in the array							|
	|				 |	     														|
	|	timeout		 | The timeout in milliseconds			 						|
	|				 | 				            									|

# **ft_IRC Usage:**

## **Running the server:**

Run the makefile then wait for the project to compile until the executable is ready, you will find it in **bin** directory
after that, you can run the server as follows:

```bash
    ./ircserv <Port> <PassWord>
```

> N.B : You can connect to the server using the netcat command **nc** or the client used as reference which is [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/).

---

## **Running the bot:**

To run the bot you can run the `make bot` and than wait for the executable to be ready which you can find in **bot/bin** directory, and you can use it as follows:

```bash
    ./bot < Server Name | Server IP > <Port> <PassWord> < 1 | 2 >
```

which the last parameter determines which type of bot you want to use.
1- is Informer(Emet) bot type which by useing it you can get BTC price by calling BTCPRICE (btcprice),
 or by using DATE (date) as a command you get the date of the day.
2- is ANONYMSG as the name suggest it help a user to send a completly annonymous msg to another user.

> N.B : If you are using another OS rather than macOS you may need to Download the `curl` library:
> ```bash
>   sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
>```

# **Available commands:**

| Commands | Usage | Discription |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **PASS** | `pass <PassWord>` | The PASS command is used to set a ‘connection password’. |
| **NICK** | `nick <NickName>` | The NICK command is used to give the client a nickname or change the previous one. |
| **USER** | `user <username> 0 * <realname>` | The USER command is used at the beginning of a connection to specify the username and realname of a new user. |
